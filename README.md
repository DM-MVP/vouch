# Vouch-x

## Overview
 This document outlines the development specifications for a single-page application (SPA) designed to allow users to connect with their Arweave wallet using ArConnect, sign in with Twitter, and, if they meet the criteria (Twitter account older than 6 months), send a signed wallet request to the server for vouching purposes.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Interface
- **Connect Arweave Wallet**: Button for users to connect their Arweave wallet via ArConnect.
- **Twitter Authentication**: Option for users to sign in with their Twitter account.
- **Eligibility Check**: System checks if the Twitter account is older than 6 months.
- **Request Submission**: Button for eligible users to send a signed wallet request to the server.

### 2. Backend Services
- **Arweave Wallet Integration**: Utilize ArConnect API for wallet connection and authentication.
- **Twitter API Integration**: Implement Twitter API for user authentication and account age verification.
- **Server Communication**: Ability to receive and process signed wallet requests from the client.

#### Endpoints

- **GET /** - Healthcheck endpoint
- **GET /x** - Start Twitter Auth Process
- **GET /x/callback** - Callback endpoint

### 3. Security
- Ensure secure OAuth implementation for Twitter sign-in.
- Encrypt communication between the SPA and the server.
- Implement CSRF protection for the request submission.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Application should load within 3 seconds on standard broadband connections.
- Server response times should not exceed 2 seconds.

### 2. Scalability
- The system should be scalable to support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

### 3. Maintainability
- Code should be well-documented for easy maintenance.
- Use modular architecture for easier updates and bug fixes.

## Technologies to be used
- Frontend: React.js or similar SPA framework.
- Backend: Node.js with Express (or suitable alternative).
- Database: NoSQL database like MongoDB (if persistent storage is required).
- Authentication: OAuth for Twitter, ArConnect SDK for Arweave wallet.

## Milestones
1. **Project Setup (1 week)**: Initial setup, including repository creation, environment setup, and documentation.
2. **Frontend Development (3 weeks)**: Develop the user interface and client-side logic for the SPA.
3. **Backend Development (2 weeks)**: Develop the server-side API for handling wallet requests and Twitter authentication.
4. **Testing and Bug Fixing (2 weeks)**: Comprehensive testing of the application, followed by bug fixing.
5. **Deployment and Monitoring (1 week)**: Deploy the application and monitor its performance.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Dependency on External APIs**: Any changes in ArConnect or Twitter APIs could impact the application. Regular monitoring and prompt updates can mitigate this risk.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement regular security audits and updates to safeguard against vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
This specification outlines the development plan for an SPA that integrates Arweave and Twitter authentication, catering to users with specific Twitter account age criteria and facilitating secure wallet requests.
